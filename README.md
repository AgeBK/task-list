# React + Vite

# Initial idea

I felt like building something using React and came across an example of the classic Todo style app and thought I'd replicate it and add a few of my own touches. I didn't copy any of the JS or CSS, just did it by eye.

I hadn't actually used Vite to build a react project and read some good things about it so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I must say, I'm quite impressed with the speed of Vite so far

# What I built

Here's a link to what I found on the net and thought I'd base my Todo list on - https://react-tasklist.vercel.app/
I didn't exactly replicate it, but I did keep it very similar with a few extras.

# Features

- 5 Components.
- Tasks can be sorted by task name, priority, date and progress.
- Tasks can also be sorted ascending & descending.
- Modal style pop up to perform CRUD operations on tasks.
- Tool tip that displays notes when task title is hovered
